Notes on design of neuro evolution with CA

Each individual is a graph where nodes are operations and layers
Graph consists of:
1 - Nodes
2 - Connections
3 - Parameters

Nodes 
- start with simple initial population
- add node between existing connections (complexify)
- inputs and outputs nodes are added for each indidvidual and are not changed
- initial population is created by inserting nodes between inputs and output

Connections
- add new connection by linking two nodes
- enable / disable connection
- each new connection get incremental 'innovation number' to track history

Parameters
- each node (opertaion) has tunable parameters that can be changed
- E.g. latent space of dense or rnn

Graph evolution - in order of exploration-exploitation continuum
- Domain: add node (domain understands grammar and generates valid nets)
- History: enable / disable connection
- Topographic: crossover
- Situational: add new connection
- Normative: change parameter

- ICE Knowledge
- multiple inputs - single output which are all fixed
- initial population is randomly generated nets from input to output
- Each node consits of a cell:
-- [BN] -> [Dense with Activation | Embedding | Op] -> [BN]
